# DATA STRUCTURES

# Lists -- Ordered, index, changeable, allow duplicates, heterogenous (allows multiple datatypes)

# Tuples -- Ordered, index, Unchangeable, heterogenous

# Sets -- Unordered, heterogenous, changeable

# Dictionaries -- Unordered, heterogenous


#Assignment
# 1. Write a program to perform the following: If give a set of numbers
#       -- Program will put the mean, variance, & standard deviation of numbers
#       -- Write into a file, the value of:


# set_of_numbers = (input("Enter set of number: ").split(' ') # Give space after Entering each number 
# # print(set_of_numbers)

# index = 0

# for i in set_of_numbers:
#     index += 1
#     index = int(i)
# print(index)


#dict is automatically a hash table
